synopsis: Run IO operations asynchronously and wait for their results
description: This package provides a higher-level interface over
             threads, in which an @Async a@ is a concurrent
             thread that will eventually deliver a value of
             type @a@.  The package provides ways to create
             @Async@ computations, wait for their results, and
             cancel them.
             .
             Using @Async@ is safer than using threads in two
             ways:
             .
             * When waiting for a thread to return a result,
             if the thread dies with an exception then the
             caller must either re-throw the exception
             ('wait') or handle it ('waitCatch'); the
             exception cannot be ignored.
             .
             * The API makes it possible to build a tree of
             threads that are automatically killed when
             their parent dies (see 'withAsync').
